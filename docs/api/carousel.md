## Carousel component props

* ```value: Number```: Current slide's index (zero based, depends on the elements order).

* ```onChange: Function```: Handler triggered when current slide is about to change (e.g. on arrow click or on swipe).

* ```onSlideClick: Function```: OnClick callback. Triggered when user click on a carousel slide (return slide index).

* ```slides: Array``` Alternative way to pass slides. This prop expects an array of JSX \<img\> elements.

* ```slidesPerPage: Number```: Number of slides visible at once.

* ```slidesPerScroll: Number```: Number by which value will change on scroll (autoPlay, arrow click, drag).

* ```itemWidth: Number```: Determines custom width for every slide in the carousel.

* ```offset: Number```: Padding between items.

* ```arrows: Boolean```: Renders default arrows.
